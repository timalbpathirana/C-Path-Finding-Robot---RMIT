/* 
TheNodeclass represents a position of the robot. It is a tuple(col,row,distance_travelled), which is thex-ylocation of the robot, and the distance that the algorithm took to reach that position from the robotâ€™sstarting position. It contains getters for this information and setter fordistance_travelled.
